Explanation of IVA exploitation. Note this technique is very new so this is a theory. 
# IVA
The idea of IVA exploitation is to bypass checks imposed in apps like Safari. 
Here's how to use the technique:
Let's say we need to store something in variable a, but there are checks. Here's what we would do. 
* Create junk variable (optional)
(Let's refer to this as variable b. IF YOU DO NOT CREATE A JUNK VARIABLE, YOU WILL HAVE TO USE A PREDEFINED VARIABLE)
* Store text in junk variable b
(THIS TEXT IS WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN STORED DIRECTLY, IF THERE WERE NO CHECKS)
* Assign variable a to junk variable b


(hopefully bypassing checks, as i did in IHVM-klm, which may be published later.

if so, link: (NOT RELEASED, yet))


DONE!
